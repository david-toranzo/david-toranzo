I'm Unity developer and computer science student. I love the video games, I learned by myself and in 2022 I started working in a professional team as Unity Developer. I consider myself a lover of clean code and sports. In my free time I made games and participate in jams.

<p> ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently using Unity, with the best practices and clean code. </p>
<p> ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning of AR, patterns and Playfab</p>
